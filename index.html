        I am currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://viaduct.ai" target="_blank">viaduct.ai</a>, a venture-backed startup providing machine learning solutions for connected vehicles. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a> as the head teaching assistant for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine">AI for Medicine Specialization</a>, available on Coursera. In college, I worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/" target="_blank">Stanford ML Group</a>, publishing research at the intersection of AI and Medicine. I recieved my M.S. in Computer Science in March 2020 and my B.S. in Mathematics in June 2019, both from Stanford University.  My CV is available <a href="assets/Bora_resume_10152020.pdf">here</a>.

        <br/>In this paper, we developed a deep learning assistant for distinguishing between subtypes of primary liver carcinoma and evaluated it in a retrospective cross-over study involving eleven pathologists of different specialties and experience levels. We found that, despite the model itself having high accuracy on an independent test set, only nine of eleven pathologists experienced an improvement in accuracy (in fact, two pathologists performed worse). We found that pathologists on average performed four times better (in terms of odds ratio)  when the model provided the correct diagnosis than without the model. However, when the model provided the wrong diagnosis, they performed about a third as well as when they were on their own. These results suggest the potential presence of automation bias. We conclude that future research should explore effect of various design decisions on joint human-AI performance of deep learning-based diagnostic support systems.

        <br/>We analyzed the voting behavior of indivudals participating in public, consensus voting schemes from a game theoretic perspective. We presented a model of public voting incorporating social pressures and proved the existence of an equilibrium in which truthfulness of votes decays as number of individuals increases in consensus voting. We then compared qualitative predictions from model with empirical evidence from a community at Stanford which implements consensus voting. Our findings suggest that instead of acting as a vehicle for change, public consensus voting may in fact reinforce status quo.

        <h3> Projects </h3>
        <b>Functional Analysis of Wearable Data</b>
        <br/>with Lilia Chang
        <br>
        <br/>In this project, we sought to extract important features from longitudinal wearable data using various functional data analysis techqniues. The methods we applied, the discrete fourier transform, PCA, nonnegative matrix factorization, and kmeans, were all variants of matrix factorization. We validated these methods on the downstream task of predicting resting heart rate of tracked subjects. We found that applying the DFT to data on a weekly timescale gave the best predictive performance, suggesting that regularity of activity patterns on longer time scales may help explain variation in patient fitness, even after accoutning for average activity levels. Finally, we discuss possible interpretations of different frequency components of the DFT as well as their implications for resting heart rate.
