        Hello, and welcome to my website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://viaduct.ai" target="_blank">viaduct.ai</a>, a startup providing machine learning solutions for connected vehicles.
        Before that, I worked at <a href="https://deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a> as the head teaching assistant for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine">AI for Medicine Specialization</a>, available on Coursera.
        In college, I worked as a research assistant at the <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/" target="_blank">Stanford ML Group</a>, publishing research at the intersection of AI and Medicine.
        I received my M.S. in Computer Science in March 2020 and my B.S. in Mathematics in June 2019, both from Stanford University.  My CV is available <a href="assets/Bora-resume-Jan-2021.pdf">here</a>.
