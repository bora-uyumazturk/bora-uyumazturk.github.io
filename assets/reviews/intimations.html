    In Intimations, a new collection of essays composed in the midst of lockdown, Zadie Smith asks an essential question: What is it that we really miss during a pandemic? For her, the answer is simple: strangers. The comfort of that familiar but unknowable face. Empty conversations on the weather. Spontaneous eye contact, long enough to acknowledge the moment yet not so long as to be impolite. The image is painfully poignant. Cloistered in her home with the people she knows best and loves most, Smith dedicates her time to the hundreds of people whose barely perceived presence comprises the texture of life, texture which for now and the foreseeable future will be experienced through a layer of cloth.

    In the first half of the book, Smith allows her mind to wander through three leisurely personal essays. Indeed, there are times when her deviations seem somewhat haphazard, veering off for a bit to discuss US healthcare policy, then making a hard left turn her towards personal poetics before eventually returning to a conversation she eavesdropped on in a coffeeshop. These liberties could be forgiven, given the circumstances, as an unconscious reaction to being physically cooped up. It is clear, however, that this is in fact an explicit stylistic choice, an attempt to embed in her writing life’s incidental music which the pandemic has silenced. “Writing is resistance”, she explains in her opening essay, a defense as convincing as it concise.

    Her circuitous paths are lined with striking articulations of our new, socially-distanced lifestyle. The humor of the struggling busybody is not lost on her: “…like pugs who having been lifted out of a body of water, our little limbs keep pumping on.”. At other times she is brutally sober, fully acknowledging the episodes of suffering which seem to target everyone. This is not to say that this is an equal-opportunity virus. Smith never fails to remind us that this pandemic, too, respects the boundaries, defined by zip codes, ethnicities, gender, and income brackets, which partition the American experience.

    Smith’s analytical and narrative skills are braided together in a series of character-driven vignettes which she refers to suggestively as Screengrabs (a pun on the now digitized nature of our interpersonal interactions). They are short, a couple of pages at the most, and each typically take the form of an intimate portrait which triggers a brief but insightful meditation. Her subjects are people Smith has only a cursory relationship with (her masseuse, an elderly neighbor), a fact which makes the depth of her psychological investigations are all the more impressive. The mere sight of an unnamed, sign-carrying man in the park seeds a discussion on America’s curious elevation of hate crime, while unexpected encounter with the library IT guy sparks a discussion of personal style and its outsized role in the lives of today’s youth. In less skilled hands, such reflections might feel strained, a poor excuse to wax poetic. Coming from Smith, however, they feel natural. She is not wringing meaning out of these characters. She merely gives them space to breath and finds, more often than not, that they have plenty to say.

    The book concludes with an enumeration, a list of names, each accompanied with a short passage describing their influence on her. The style is casual, and her fragmented delivery heightens the emotional impact. She mixes miscellaneous first names (Hannah, Darren, Ben) with celebrities (Muhammad Ali), and literary idols (Virginia Woolf), implying that they all deserve to occupy the same space in her head. One lesson, from Devorah, tells Smith to “write your own sentences as if you have no more ownership over the lines than a stranger.” Clearly Smith has clearly taken this advice and run with it. What at first seems like a frivolous accounting, a waltz down memory lane, is in fact far more serious. This concluding section, an to an extent the the entire book, is Zadie Smith citing her sources.
