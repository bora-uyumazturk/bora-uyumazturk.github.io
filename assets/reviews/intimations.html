      In <i>Intimations</i>, a new collection of essays written during lockdown, Zadie Smith asks an essential question: what do we miss the most in a pandemic? For her, the answer is simple: strangers. That familiar yet distant face. A pointless back-and-forth on the weather. Spontaneous eye contact, long enough to acknowledge the moment yet not so long as to be impolite. The image is painfully poignant. Cloistered in her home with her closest relations, Smith dedicates her creative energy to those figures who are just barely recognizable, yet whose presence comprises the texture of life—texture which must, for now and the foreseeable future, be experienced through a sanitary layer of cloth.

      Smith meanders freely through the first few essays, tiptoeing the line between eclectic and haphazard. In the first essay alone she veers off to discuss <i>Lolita</i>, moves on to her own womanhood by way of Aretha Franklin, then takes a hard left turn towards her personal poetics before finally returning to her original subject, a couple of tulips growing in a New York City community garden. These liberties could be forgiven, given the circumstances, as an unconscious reaction to being physically cooped up. In fact, this is an explicit stylistic choice, an attempt to embed in her writing life’s incidental music which the pandemic has silenced. “Writing is resistance”, she explains, a defense as convincing as it concise.

      The circuitous paths she carves through her subjects are lined with striking articulations of our new, socially-distanced lifestyle. The humor of the struggling busybody is not lost on her: “…like pugs who having been lifted out of a body of water, our little limbs keep pumping on.”. At other times she is brutally sober, fully acknowledging the episodes of despair which many have felt at one point or another during isolation. This not to say that this is an equal-opportunity virus. Smith never fails to remind us that this pandemic, too, respects the boundaries, defined by zip codes, ethnicities, gender, and income brackets, which partition the American experience.

      Smith’s analytical and narrative skills are braided together in a series of character-driven vignettes which she refers to as Screengrabs (a joke on the now virtual nature of our interactions). They are short, a couple of pages at the most, and each typically take the form of an intimate portrait which triggers a brief but insightful meditation. Her subjects are people Smith has only a cursory relationship with (her masseuse, an elderly neighbor), a fact which makes the depth of her psychological investigations all the more impressive. In less skilled hands, such reflections might feel strained, a poor excuse to wax poetic. Coming from Smith, however, they feel natural. She does not wring meaning out of these characters. She merely gives them space to breath and finds, more often than not, that they have plenty to say.

      The book concludes with an enumeration, a list of names, each accompanied with a short passage describing their influence on her. The style is casual, and her fragmented delivery heightens the emotional impact. She mixes miscellaneous first names (Hannah, Darren, Ben) with celebrities (Muhammad Ali), and literary idols (Virginia Woolf), the implication being that they all deserve to occupy the same space in her head, a nontrivial statement. One lesson, from a woman named Devorah, teaches Smith to “write your own sentences as if you have no more ownership over the lines than a stranger.” Clearly Smith has clearly taken this advice and run with it. What at first seems like a frivolous accounting, a waltz down memory lane, is in fact far more serious. This concluding section, and to some extent the the entire book, is Smith’s way of citing her sources.
