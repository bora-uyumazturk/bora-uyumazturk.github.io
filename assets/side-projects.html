          <div class="publication-title">GPT-3 Sandbox</div>
          <div/>with Shreya Shankar<div>
          <p>
            The purpose of this repository is to allow users to quickly create a web demos for their GPT-3 related project
            ideas using only a few lines of Python. We take care of all the boilerplate front-end code and provide a clean,
            object-oriented interface to the GPT-3 API, making it quick and easy to start testing out your ideas without
            requiring any web dev skills whatsoever. For a list of interesting GPT-3 related project (a few of which were
            created with the help of GPT-3 Sandbox), check out <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/", target="_blank">gpt3examples.com</a>.

          <div class="publication-title">Functional Analysis of Wearable Data</div>
          <div>with Lilia Chang</div>

          <p>
            In this project, we sought to extract important features from longitudinal wearable data using various functional data analysis techqniues. The methods we applied, the discrete fourier transform, PCA, nonnegative matrix factorization, and kmeans, were all variants of matrix factorization. We validated these methods on the downstream task of predicting resting heart rate of tracked subjects. We found that applying the DFT to data on a weekly timescale gave the best predictive performance, suggesting that regularity of activity patterns on longer time scales may help explain variation in patient fitness, even after accoutning for average activity levels. Finally, we discuss possible interpretations of different frequency components of the DFT as well as their implications for resting heart rate.
