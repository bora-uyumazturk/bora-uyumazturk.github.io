    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    Here is a list of what I've been reading, organized by year. Eventually I hope to add
    short reviews/summaries for selected books. I've split the books up into poetry, fiction,
    nonfiction, and criticism to make things easier to navigate. Hopefully you find it
    helpful.
