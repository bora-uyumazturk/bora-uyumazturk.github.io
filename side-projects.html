    A business-card inspired personal website layout (using myself as an
    example). Mainly an excuse to play with

  <div class="publication-title">GPT-3 Sandbox</div>
  <div />
  with Shreya Shankar
  <div>
    <p>
      The purpose of this repository is to allow users to quickly create a web
      demos for their GPT-3 related project ideas using only a few lines of
      Python. We take care of all the boilerplate front-end code and provide a
      clean, object-oriented interface to the GPT-3 API, making it quick and
      easy to start testing out your ideas without requiring any web dev skills
      whatsoever. For a list of interesting GPT-3 related project (a few of
      which were created with the help of GPT-3 Sandbox), check out
      <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank">gpt3examples.com</a>.

    <div class="publication-title">Functional Analysis of Wearable Data</div>
    <div>with Lilia Chang</div>

    <p>
      In this project, we sought to extract important features from longitudinal
      wearable data using various functional data analysis techqniues. The
      methods we applied, the discrete fourier transform, PCA, nonnegative
      matrix factorization, and kmeans, were all variants of matrix
      factorization. We validated these methods on the downstream task of
      predicting resting heart rate of tracked subjects. We found that applying
      the DFT to data on a weekly timescale gave the best predictive
      performance, suggesting that regularity of activity patterns on longer
      time scales may help explain variation in patient fitness, even after
      accoutning for average activity levels. Finally, we discuss possible
      interpretations of different frequency components of the DFT as well as
      their implications for resting heart rate.
